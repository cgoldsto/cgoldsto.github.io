                      <li>
                        I co-developed the PetPals concept with a group for a course project.

                        Pet Pals is a smart pet product that allows users to experience pet ownership without real-life hassle and commitment.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        For our product, we created a “smart pet” that uses two channels:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The first channel is a mobile app that allows users to customize and interact with their pets. Users could take their pets out for a walk, check their health, shop for their pet's needs and interact with other friends through the app's messaging system, Petbook.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The second channel is the PetPal itself. The physical pet would have an interface that displays its real-time mood/emotions and also displays alerts/notifications such as messages from other users. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        While there are existing websites to support content creators, these websites only provide some of the information that would help my company’s content creators.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                                The primary goal was to create a realistic experience, where users feel like they are really caring for a pet. 
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Although many factors come into play when taking care of a pet in real life, we tried to include some of the key ones like basic interactions and going for walks.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                We also wanted users to feel like their pet was unique. PetPals users can customize their pet's physical attributes including eye color, shell color, and personality.

                                <li>
                                    To start brainstorming features, we did a Crazy Eights brainstorming exercise. Using Figjam, each team member sketched eight ideas in eight minutes, putting an emphasis on quick idea generation.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Afterward, we discussed the ideas from each person’s sketches and came to a consensus. We decided to include the following key features:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Ability to choose the pet’s personality traits

                                        <li>
                                            Tab design for the pet’s inventory (separate tabs for treats, toys, accessories, etc.)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            A friends list to connect with other pets

                                        Next, the group focused on creating a mood board. Each member made their own mood board and then we came together as a group and noted what we liked on each other’s mood board, while we went over them.

                                        Skylar is excited to create her PetPal and connect with friends’ pets. She downloads the PetPals app, signs up, and taps the “Create” button. On the app, Skylar chooses the type of pet she wants, her pet’s name, features, and personality traits. Skylar can choose to directly add friends’ pets to a “friends” list, so she can easily find them later.
                                    </p>

                                        Once Skylar customizes her PetPal, she chooses the “walk” option from the main menu. The screen shows a neighborhood, with an animation of her pet walking on the sidewalk. The walk turns out to be very strenuous for her pet, and it becomes thirsty. Skylar now has to interact with her pet and give it water through its display interface.
                                    </p>

                                            Leroy has a busy day of teaching ahead of him with few breaks. While at work he finds a few extra minutes between classes to check up on his pet. He logs into the PetPals app to see how his pet is doing. He sees that his pet feels somewhat hungry. Using the app, he directs his pet toward a virtual food bowl. Leroy can see his pet eating on screen, and he can see his pet’s hunger score improve.

Afterward, he sees his PetPal smile on the display interface indicating it is happy and healthy. On the app, Leroy can also see that his PetPal’s fun and social scores have increased.

                                                Once we developed our mid-fi prototype, our team began user testing by conducting research study interviews with testing participants. Our main goal for usability testing was to test the navigation and function of our app and physical PetPal interface in its current mid-fi state. The results helped our team evaluate the current design and guided discussions on the future changes we needed to implement for the high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype.

                                                Referring back to our target audience, the participants we chose were women and men between the ages of 18-29, as we found these are the target groups for apps similar to ours. Our ideal users were also good with technology and/or like gadgets, and appreciate products that evoke 1990s nostalgia. Due to our limited resources for usability testing, participants were people we personally knew who fit into our target audience.

                                                We created a test plan and a faciliator script to ensure each testing session was the same. That way, the results from each team member's tests could be evaluated equally.

                                                    On the “Choose Your Pet” screen, the user initially tried to edit the pet’s name by clicking “Pet Name” at the top of the screen. Since naming is not part of the testing protocol, we did not build out the pet name editing function.
                                                </li>

                                                <li>
                                                    The participant thought that changing the pet on the app would also change the physical PetPal. For example, if the user selected a big red cat in the app, he would expect to see the image on the right turn into a big red cat.
                                                </li>

                                                <li>
                                                    The participant hesitated for a moment after choosing the animal’s type, color, and size. He mentioned the personality traits that were in the test prompt, so he may have expected the personality sliders to be on the “Choose Your Pet” page, instead of on a different page. However, he did not explicitly state this.

                                                    Once the participant reached the map screen, he tried to click and drag to create a walking path. The Axure prototype only allows users to click on the map and then see a predetermined route.
                                                </li>

                                                    When the participant clicked on New Friend 1, he initially tried to select “Speak” from the popup menu. The participant did not explicitly state this, but since the task required the user to chat with the new friend, the participant may have thought that “Speak” meant sending messages (as opposed to sending them through the PetBook chat function).

                                                    Two participants were confused and thought the pet customization sliders would change the physical PetPal’s appearance, instead of changing the virtual avatar within the app.

                                                    Our recommendation to fix this issue would be to remove the options that resemble a live pet (type of animal, size, etc) and make them more applicable to the virtual avatar in the app. This will help meet the user’s expectations more, as to where the customizations will appear. We will also move the app screen and the physical PetPal further apart in Axure and add labels above the app screen and the physical PetPal, to clearly indicate that these are two separate interfaces.

                                                    A few participants spent a good amount of time trying to use features that weren’t implemented yet on the prototypes. One user went to edit the “Pet Name” field on the first pet customization page, as there was an edit icon and a second participant saw the “randomize” button on the PepPals customization wasn’t working. These features were not necessary to complete the tasks we gave them, so it seemed clear to us (the project group) that users would not interact with them. However, user-testing participants might think of things differently and end up spending a significant amount of time and effort going down the wrong path.

For the next iteration, it may be helpful to clearly separate tasks/functions for each channel and/or remind users they can interact with the PetPal device.

This feature wasn’t implemented in the mid-fi prototype; instead, we set it up to have users simply click on the map, as we didn’t find a way to successfully have users create a path with Axure. As a result, participants weren’t told anywhere to click instead of draw, and many faced issues trying to draw their own paths. 
                                                </p>

                                                    Our solution for this would be to explain any prototype limitations while reading off the tasks, so participants do not think they did something wrong. We will try to implement the draw function on the map for the hi-fi prototype. If we cannot successfully implement it, we will try to generate a random path every time the user clicks on the map.

One user wasn’t sure where her start point on the map for Task 2 was. The other user noticed that while the “energy” bar depleted, the “happiness” bar didn’t change.

During the walk or after the walk we will try and change the happiness bar to update how the pet is feeling, thus solving the second issue seen on this screen.

We came up with a color scheme that consisted of a deep orange, an orange-yellow, a neutral cream, teal, and navy blue. We also finalized the logo which appears on every screen of the app's interface. These changes along with the interactions made our product look close to the final version. The hi-fi version of our prototype also includes the changes we made from our user testing with the mid-fi prototype. On the next page are some of the screens from our hi-fi prototype.

                                                                Our team had a quick brainstorming/sketching session before we began creating the mid-fi prototype. It helped the team get on the same page with how to begin developing the mobile app and PetPal device. Doing a brainstorming activity and discussing what we liked and how everything could be implemented together helped us flesh out ideas before we could commit to anything.
                                                            </li>

                                                                During the development and iterative revision process, we realized the importance of being intentional about what is or is not shown on-screen. Some user-testing participants tried to click on elements that we did not fully flesh out. For example, on the “Choose Your Pet” page, participants tried to click on the Pet Name field and the Randomize button. Neither of those elements were necessary to complete our user test tasks, so we did not make them interactive. However, participants were confused by the presence of these buttons and their lack of interactivity.
                                                                <ul>
                                                                    <li>
                                                                        We accounted for this when creating our hi-fi prototype; we removed some distractions. For example, we removed a menu bar icon from the app’s header, since we were not planning to make it interactive. Instead, relevant buttons appear on each page to guide the user. The home screen also includes a bottom navigation menu with more details, including icons and labels for each menu item.
                                                                    </li>
                                                                </ul>
                                                            </li>

                                                            <li>
                                                                We also noticed that having a style guide helped immensely when we created our hi-fi prototype. Since we only had so much time to flesh out the mid-fi prototype, the team split up the work and we were able to create a more consistent and cohesive prototype by following the style guide.
