                      <li>
                        I co-developed the PetPals concept with a group for a course project.

                        Pet Pals is a smart pet product that allows users to experience pet ownership without real-life hassle and commitment.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        For our product, we created a “smart pet” that uses two channels:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The first channel is a mobile app that allows users to customize and interact with their pets. Users could take their pets out for a walk, check their health, shop for their pet's needs and interact with other friends through the app's messaging system, Petbook.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The second channel is the PetPal itself. The physical pet would have an interface that displays its real-time mood/emotions and also displays alerts/notifications such as messages from other users. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        While there are existing websites to support content creators, these websites only provide some of the information that would help my company’s content creators.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                                The primary goal was to create a realistic experience, where users feel like they are really caring for a pet. 
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Although many factors come into play when taking care of a pet in real life, we tried to include some of the key ones like basic interactions and going for walks.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                We also wanted users to feel like their pet was unique. PetPals users can customize their pet's physical attributes including eye color, shell color, and personality.

                                <li>
                                    To start brainstorming features, we did a Crazy Eights brainstorming exercise. Using Figjam, each team member sketched eight ideas in eight minutes, putting an emphasis on quick idea generation.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Afterward, we discussed the ideas from each person’s sketches and came to a consensus. We decided to include the following key features:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Ability to choose the pet’s personality traits

                                        <li>
                                            Tab design for the pet’s inventory (separate tabs for treats, toys, accessories, etc.)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            A friends list to connect with other pets

                                        Next, the group focused on creating a mood board. Each member made their own mood board and then we came together as a group and noted what we liked on each other’s mood board, while we went over them.

                                        Skylar is excited to create her PetPal and connect with friends’ pets. She downloads the PetPals app, signs up, and taps the “Create” button. On the app, Skylar chooses the type of pet she wants, her pet’s name, features, and personality traits. Skylar can choose to directly add friends’ pets to a “friends” list, so she can easily find them later.
                                    </p>

                                        Once Skylar customizes her PetPal, she chooses the “walk” option from the main menu. The screen shows a neighborhood, with an animation of her pet walking on the sidewalk. The walk turns out to be very strenuous for her pet, and it becomes thirsty. Skylar now has to interact with her pet and give it water through its display interface.
                                    </p>

                                            Leroy has a busy day of teaching ahead of him with few breaks. While at work he finds a few extra minutes between classes to check up on his pet. He logs into the PetPals app to see how his pet is doing. He sees that his pet feels somewhat hungry. Using the app, he directs his pet toward a virtual food bowl. Leroy can see his pet eating on screen, and he can see his pet’s hunger score improve.

                                            When Leroy gets home, he interacts with his PetPal using the display interface. From the interface menu, he chooses to teach his pet a new trick. Afterward, he sees his PetPal smile on the display interface indicating it is happy and healthy. On the app, Leroy can also see that his PetPal’s fun and social scores have increased.

                                                            The contact form asks users to identify their division within the company. This helps the CommSpot team direct the question to someone who has experience in that particular topic area.
